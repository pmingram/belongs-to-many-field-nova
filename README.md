### Installation
```bash
composer require benjacho/belongs-to-many-field
```

## Deprecation
Method relationModel() no more needed, to prevent conflicts it will be there. And trait HasBelongsToMany no more neede too, both will be in repo, but doesn't work.

### Usage

To use in nova 1.0 use 0.3 in nova 2.0 use 0.4 and above.

In the resource you need to pass:

- Method make (label, many to many relationship, Nova Resource Relationship)
- Method options (Here you pass options that you need to render in Multiple Select, you can pass Querys, use get() method for that purpose)
- You dont need to pass onlyOnForms(), it is by default.

```php
use Benjacho\BelongsToManyField\BelongsToManyField;

public function fields(Request $request){
    BelongsToManyField::make('Role Label', 'roles', 'App\Nova\Role')->options(\App\Role::all()),
}
```

Optional

- Method optionsLabel('columnName'), this method is when you don't have column 'name' in your table and you want to label by another column name. By default it tracks by label 'name'


```php
use Benjacho\BelongsToManyField\BelongsToManyField;

public function fields(Request $request){
    BelongsToManyField::make('Role Label', 'roles', 'App\Nova\Role')->options(\App\Role::all())->optionsLabel('title'),
}
```

- Method isAction(), this method is when you need this field in actions, this puts height of field in 350px, and converts in action.

```php
use Benjacho\BelongsToManyField\BelongsToManyField;

public function fields(Request $request){
    BelongsToManyField::make('Role Label', 'roles', 'App\Nova\Role')->options(\App\Role::all())->isAction(),
}
```
To obtain the data that is send in action do it: 

```php
public function handle(ActionFields $fields, Collection $models)
{
    // Get the expenseTypes from the request because the Field BelongsToManyField does not send it
    
    $values = array_column(json_decode(request()->roles, true),'id');
    
    foreach ($models as $model) {
        $model->roles()->sync($values);
    }
}
```

### Validations
This package implement all Laravel Validations, you need to pass the rules in rules method, rules are listed on laravel validations rules for arrays*.

```php
use Benjacho\BelongsToManyField\BelongsToManyField;

public function fields(Request $request){
    BelongsToManyField::make('Role Label', 'roles', 'App\Nova\Role')->options(\App\Role::all())->relationModel(\App\User::class)->rules('required', 'min:1', 'max:5', 'size:3' new CustomRule),
}
